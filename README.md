# Demo Next.js App

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js v10 or higher

### Installing dependencies

The first time you clone this repo, as well as any time you pull/switch branches, you should update the project's
dependencies by running `npm install`

Copy the .env.SAMPLE file to a file called .env by running `cp .env.SAMPLE .env`. You will populate this file in the
next few steps.

Set up authentication by following the instructions in [docs/auth0.md](./docs/auth0.md).

### Running on localhost

To run on localhost, run `npm run dev`. The app will run on http://localhost:3000.

### Deploying

To deploy this app, you will need [zeit.co account](https://zeit.co/signup). Run `now login` (in this directory) to
login to your account.

To copy secrets to your new account, run `./uploadSecrets.sh`.
You will need to run this command any time your secrets change.

Once you've uploaded your secrets, run `now`. The first time you deploy your app, you will be asked a few questions
about the app. For most of the questions, you can hit enter to go with the suggested value, though you may want to
choose your own app name.

If your deployment was successful, the link to the production app should be copied to your clipboard. The first time
you do this, you will have to make a small modification to your Auth0 configuration. Follow the instructions under
"After your first deploy" in [docs/auth0.md](./docs/auth0.md).
