# Demo Next.js App

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v10 or higher

- For installation advice, see: <https://ucsb-cs48.github.io/jstopics/node/>

## Installing dependencies

The first time you clone this repo, as well as any time you pull/switch branches, you should update the project's
dependencies by running `npm install`

## Obtaining Secrets

To work properly, this application must be configured to use Google OAuth
using the Auth0 service.

This involves:

- Setting up an Auth0 account (if you do not already have one)
- Configuring an application
- Copying the value of three "secrets" into a file called `.env`

All of these instructions can be found in this file:
[docs/auth0-localhost.md](docs/auth0-localhost.md)

Follow _all_ of the instructions in that file _before_ trying to
run the application on localhost.

## Running on localhost

To run on localhost, run:

```
npm run dev
```

The app will run on <http://localhost:3000>.

While the app is running in development mode, any changes you make to
the codebase will automatically be reflected in the browser.

## Commands

| Command                | Description                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `npm run test`         | Runs entire test suite                   |
| `npm run test:format`  | Checks the project for formatting issues |
| `npm run test:cypress` | Runs Cypress integration tests           |
| `npm run fix:format`   | Reformats all project files              |

## Configuring secrets for GitHub Actions

If the test cases were passing on the starter code repo, but are now
failing, it is likely because you need to configure the secrets
for Github Actions. That process is explained here: [docs/auth0-github-actions.md](./docs/auth0-github-actions.md).

## Deploying to now.sh for the first time

To deploy this app, you will need a [zeit.co account](https://zeit.co/signup).
* Signup for an account before proceeding.  We recommend using your GitHub credentials to login

Run `npx now login` (in this directory) to login to your account.
* When asked for an email, if you used GitHub to sign in to zeit.co, you should use the same email that is the 
  primary email on your GitHub account.
* When signing in for the first time, you'll be asked to confirm your email.  Be sure that you can 
  get access to read an email sent to the email address that you typed it.
  
To deploy your project, run `npx now --prod`. The first time you run this command, you will be prompted with a
series of questions.

For most of these questions, you can hit enter to use the suggested value.
**When asked "What's your project's name", enter in a project name in the form _`cs48-githubid-lab00`_,
replacing _`githubid`_ with your github id**

If the deployment was successful, you should see the line `âœ… Production: <production url> [copied to clipboard]`.
`<production url>` is the link to your running production app. If you are working locally, this value should be
copied to your clipboard.

If you visit your production app, you may notice that your app is responding with a 500 Internal Server Error. This
is because the server has not been configured with your Auth0 configuration.

To set this up, run `npm run setup`. You will be prompted to paste the url of your production app, which you should have
from when you first deployed the app. The setup script will automatically upload your credentials and redeploy your app.

You will also have to make a small modification to your Auth0 configuration. Follow the instructions in
[docs/auth0-production.md](./docs/auth0-production.md) to configure your
app for OAuth.

Then, test whether your application works on the production URL.

# The value of `SESSION_COOKIE_SECRET`

You will note that in addition to the three secrets defined for Auth0,
there is another value defined in the file `next.config.js` and in the
file `setup_now.js` called `SESSION_COOKIE_SECRET`.

The value of `SESSION_COOKIE_SECRET` can be set to any arbitrary long
unguessable string. It is used to provide extra cryptographic security
to make it more difficult for hackers to hijack sessions on a web server.

When running on `localhost`, or on CI, a default value can be used.
This default value is defined in the file `next.config.js`

When running in production, it is important to define a good
unguessable value, and not use a default value that can be found
in source code. In this app, the script `setup_now.js` does
this with the line of code:

```
 const cookieSecret = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString("hex");
```
